PasswordBannedList
==================
I've made a module for checking a password against a banned list. The list comes from the 10,000 most common password list (https://xato.net/passwords/more-top-worst-passwords/) and when input will produce an error informing the user that their password is in the list and a more secure password should be used.

The banned list is found in the module as banned.list so passwords can be added/removed as required.
